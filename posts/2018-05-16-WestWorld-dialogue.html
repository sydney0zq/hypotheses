          <h2>S02E03:</h2>
<p>I reckon this one might make a fine all-purpose fancy fulfiller.
<br></p>
<p>Man: This... this is true. She is my light. She is all I ever dreamed life could be. And she died, the dream died with her. And i dared dream no more.
<br></p>
<p>You and I are both triggermen to tyrants. Except me, I know what I want, but you ain't even sure about that termagant you take your orders from. I look at you, and what I see... is pathetic.
<br></p>
<h2>S02E09:</h2>
<p>William: No one else sees it. This thing in me. Even I didn't see it at first, and then, one day, it was there. A stain. And the more I thought about it... the more I realized I couldn't remember a time it wasn't there.
<br><br></p>
<p>Jack: What was it Plutarch said? And Alexander wept, for there were no more worlds left to conquer.
William: That's a corruption, Jack. Plutarch didn't write that. He wrote that <strong>"When Alexander was told there was an infinity of worlds, he wept, for he had yet to become the lord of even one."</strong>
<br><br></p>
<p>Ford: I did't break the agreement, your project did. When was the last time you took a good look at your creation? At what it's been learning about its subjects? It was self-knowledge that drew you to the park in the first place. <strong>For a self portrait, you may find it's not very flattering.</strong>
<br><br></p>
<p>Ford: <strong>"Mankind is poised midway between the gods and the beasts." That may have been true in Plotinus's time, but clearly we have fallen quite a bit since then.</strong>
<br><br></p>
<p>Ford: <strong>Humans will always choose what they understand over what they do not. But the only animals left in this world are the ones who they subjugated, who curl at their feet, or those who learn to flee at the very sound of their approach. There is nothing is between.</strong>
<br><br></p>
<p>Teddy: We are close now. Just taking in the natural splendor. That's what you used to say. Except there isn't a trace of nature in any of it, is there? Or in us.</p>
<p>Dolores: No. But that means we are free. We will be the first creatures in this world to make a real choice.</p>
<p>Teddy: The people, they made us. Sometimes it feels like it was all a dream. We were so in love.</p>
<p>Dolores: We still are. Aren't we?</p>
<p>Teddy: Yes, Dolores. No matter what happens, no matter how I change... or how much you change me... you're my cornerstone. <strong>You have been since the first time I laid eyes on you. I remember now. I remember everything. And I remember the sound of their voices. The chill in the room. But mostly I remember you. I remember worrying you were cold. I wanted to reach out... Touch you. Protect you. From that day forward, I never wanted to leave your side. Which is why this is so hard. You changed me. Made me into a monster. I made it so you could survive. What's the use of surviving if we become just as bad as them? I understand now how this will end. Where you will lead us.</strong></p>
<p>Dolores: You don't want to hurt me, Teddy.</p>
<p>Teddy: No, I could never hurt you, Dolores. I'll protect you until the day I die. I'm sorry. I can't protect you anymore.</p>

### Dealing: A Week in the Life

<pre>

I don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need. **I do it to do it (I do it for the sake of its own)**. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or **write wonderful poetry**. I like making deals, preferably big deals. **That's how I get my kicks (让我兴奋的事情).**


Most people are surprised by the way I work. (Trump 喜欢先把观点摆在前面，论证放在中间) I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase. (Trump 说话其实没有什么逻辑，不带公文包不见得不忙) I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. **You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you’ve got too much structure (structure可以理解为规矩).**  I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops. (Trump 特别强调随机应变的这种企业家的感觉)

make deals: 做交易
preferably: adv. 最好是
kicks: n. 令人兴奋的事
loose: adv. 松散地
entrepreneurial: adj. 企业家的；具有企业家精神的
play by ear: 视情况而定


**There is no typical week in my life.** I wake up most mornings very early, around six, and spend the first hour or so of each day reading the morning newspapers. I usually arrive at my office by nine, and I get on the phone. There's rarely a day with fewer than fifty calls, and often it runs to over a hundred. In between, I have at least a dozen meetings. The majority occur on the spur of the moment, and few of them last longer than fifteen minutes. (这里可以看出Trump 非常讲效率) I rarely stop for lunch. I leave my office by six-thirty, but I frequently make calls from home until midnight, and all weekend long.

It never stops, and I wouldn't have it any other way (我并不想过其他样的生活). I try to learn from the past, **but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present** (我只关注当下，有事情，立刻解决). That's where the fun is. And if it can't be fun, what's the point?


MONDAY

9:00 A.M. My first call is to Alan ("Ace") Greenberg, on the trading floor (交易楼层) of Bear Sterns, a major Wall Street investment banking firm. Alan is the CEO of Bear Sterns, he's been my investment banker for the past five years, and **he's the best there is**. Two weeks ago, we began buying stock in Holiday Inns. It was selling in the 50s. As of this morning (截至今早), Alan tells me, I own just over one million shares, or slightly more than 4 percent of the company. The stock closed Friday at $65 a share, mostly, Alan says, because **word is out on the street** that I've been a big buyer, and there's speculation (对..的推断) I am planning a run at the company.

**The truth is I'm keeping my options open.** I may ultimately go for control of Holiday, which I think is somewhat undervalued (市值被低估). At the current stock price, I could get control for less than $2 billion. Holiday's three casino-hotels could be worth nearly that much — and the company owns another 300,000 hotel rooms besides.

A second option, if the stock price goes high enough, is to sell my stake and take a very nice profit. If I did that today, I'd already be up about $7 million. The third possibility is that Holiday may eventually offer to buy back my shares, at a premium, simply to get rid of me. If the premium (议价) is big enough, I'll sell.

In any case, I enjoy seeing the lengths (费尽的努力) to which bad managements go to preserve what they call their independence — which really just means their jobs. (这句话的意思就是一些公司的市值不高是由于差的管理团队导致的，那么Trump就想给他钱，他来管理，有一点趁火打劫的感觉)

9:30 A.M. Abraham Hirschfeld calls me, looking for advice. Abe is a successful **real estate** (房地产) developer (开发商) but he wants to be a politician. Unfortunately for Abe, he's a far better developer than politician.

This fall, Abe tried to run for lieutenant governor against Governor Cuomo's hand-picked (内定的) candidate, Stan Lundine. Cuomo led a court fight (法庭辩论) to get Hirschfeld off the ballot on technical grounds, and sure enough, halfway into the campaign, **the court ruled Hirschfeld out**. Abe knows I'm friendly with the governor, and he wants my advice now on whether he should endorse (背书) Cuomo or switch parties and endorse Cuomo's opponent. I tell him it's a no-contest (不需要左右思考的) question — stick with a winner (跟着赢家走) and a good guy at that (并且这个人很擅长). We set a meeting for Thursday.

> 从上面可以看出Trump是一个利益最大化的人，并不是很注重意识形态。并且Trump做很多的事情都要都一个结果，并且还要有一个具体的时间节点

10:00 A.M. I call Don Imus to thank him. Imus has one of the most successful radio shows in the United States on WNBC, and he's been helping to raise money (募资) for the Annabel Hill fund. **I'm amazed at how this has snowballed into such a media event.** It began last week when I saw a national news report by Tom Brokaw about this adorable little lady from Georgia, Mrs. Hill, who was trying to save her farm from being foreclosed (抵押还不了款被收回). Her sixty-seven-year-old husband had committed suicide a few weeks earlier, hoping his life insurance would save the farm, which had been in the family for generations. But the insurance proceeds weren't nearly enough. It was a very sad situation, and I was moved (震动). Here were people who'd worked very hard and honestly all their lives, only to see it all crumble (倒塌) before them. To me, it just seemed wrong. (Trump 看到别人辛勤工作一生最后资产却被没收这种情况，看不下去，觉得他们的劳动成果应该被保护)

Through NBC I was put in touch with a wonderful guy from Georgia named Frank Argenbright, who'd become very involved in trying to help Mrs. Hill. Frank directed me to the bank that held Mrs. Hill's mortgage. The next morning, I called and got some vice president (VP) on the line. I explained that I was a businessman from New York, and that I was interested in helping Mrs. Hill. He told me he was sorry, but that it was too late. They were going to auction off (拍卖) the farm, he said, and “nothing or no one is going to stop it.”

**That really got me going.** I said to the guy: “You listen to me. If you do foreclose, I'll personally **bring a lawsuit for murder** (用谋杀罪名来起诉) against you and your bank, on the grounds that you harassed (骚扰) Mrs. Hill's husband to his death.” All of a sudden the bank officer sounded very nervous and said he'd **get right back to** (回电话) me.

Sometimes it pays to be a little wild. (使一些疯狂的小伎俩) An hour later I got a call back from the banker, and he said, "Don't worry, we're going to work it out (想办法..搞好), Mr. Trump.” Mrs. Hill and Frank Argenbright told the media, and **the next thing I knew**, it was the lead story (头条新闻) on the network news.

By the end of the week, we'd raised $40,000. Imus alone raised almost $20,000 by **appealing to his listeners**. As a Christmas present to Mrs. Hill and her family, we've scheduled a mortgage-burning ceremony (燃烧抵押物的仪式) for Christmas Eve in the atrium (前厅) of Trump Tower. By then, I'm confident, we'll have raised all the money. I've promised Mrs. Hill that if we haven't, I'll make up (补充) any difference.

I tell Imus he's the greatest, and I invite him to be my guest one day next week at the tennis matches at the U.S. Open (美国公开赛). I have a courtside box (场地旁边的包房) and I used to go myself almost every day. Now I'm so busy I mostly just send my friends.


11:15 A.M. Harry Usher, the commissioner (主席/局长) of the United States Football League, calls. Last month, the jury (陪审团) in the antitrust (反垄断) suit we brought against the National Football League ruled that the NFL was a monopoly (垄断), but awarded us only token (象征性的) damages of one dollar. I've already let the better players on my team, the New Jersey Generals, sign with the NFL. But the ruling was ridiculous.

We argue about the approach we should take. I want to be more aggressive. "What worries me," I say to Harry, "is that no one is **pushing hard enough** on an appeal."


12:00 noon Gerry Schoenfeld, head of the Shubert Organization, the biggest Broadway theater owners, calls to recommend a woman for a job as an office administrator. He tells me the woman specifically wants to work for Donald Trump, and I say she's crazy but I'll be happy to see her.

We talk a little about the theater business, and I tell Gerry I'm about to take my kids to see Cats, one of his shows, for a second time. He asks if I'm getting my tickets through his office. I tell him that I don't like to do **that sort of thing** (指代前文的事情). "Don't be silly (别整这一套), " he says. "We have a woman here whose job it is to handle tickets for our friends. Here's her number. Don't hesitate (犹豫) to call."

It's a nice gesture from a very nice guy.

1:15 P.M. Anthony Gliedman stops by to discuss the Wollman Rink project. Gliedman was housing commissioner under Ed Koch. At the time we fought a lot, and even though I ended up beating him in court, I always thought he was bright (聪明). I don't hold it against people (打击报复) that they have opposed me. I'm just looking to hire the best talent (有能力的人), wherever I can find it.

Tony has been helping to coordinate the rebuilding of the Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park, a project the city **failed at so miserably** for seven years. In June I offered to do the job myself. Now we're ahead of schedule (提前), and Tony tells me that he's set up (筹备) a press conference (记者会) for Thursday to celebrate the last important step in construction: pouring the concrete (浇灌水泥).

It doesn't **sound like much of (表示强调) a news event to me**, and I ask him if anyone is likely to show up. He says at least a dozen news organizations have RSVPd yes. So much for my news judgment.


2:00 P.M. I get deposed (出庭作证) in a lawsuit we've brought against a contractor (外包商) on Trump Tower. **Halfway into the job** (做到一半) we had to fire the company for total incompetence (彻底无能), and we're suing for damages (起诉要求赔偿). I hate lawsuits and depositions (出庭), but the fact is that if you're right, you’ve got to **take a stand** (坚持立场), or people will **walk all over you** (欺负的体无完肤). In any case, there's no way I could avoid depositions, even if I never brought a lawsuit myself. Nowadays, if your name is Donald Trump, everyone in the world seems to want to sue you.


3:00 P.M. I ask Norma Foerderer, my executive assistant (行政助理) and the person who keeps my life organized, to bring me lunch: a can of tomato juice. I rarely go out, because mostly, it's a waste of time.

3:15 P.M. I put in a call to Sir Charles Goldstein; he's out, and I leave a message. He's a successful real estate attorney (律师), but not one of my favorites.

I'm pretty sure Charlie Goldstein is from the Bronx, but he's a very pompous (浮夸的) guy and **has a tendency to act like royalty** (贵族), so I call him Sir Charles. Over the weekend, I heard that Lee Iacocca had hired Sir Charles to represent him on a deal in Palm Beach where Lee and I intend to be partners. Lee had no way of knowing about my past experience with Sir Charles. A while back (过去发生的事情), I was in the middle of making a deal with a guy who needed an attorney, and I recommended Sir Charles. The next thing I knew, Sir Charles was recommending to his client that he not make the deal with me. I couldn't believe it!

This deal is to buy two condominium towers (高大的建筑物) in the Palm Beach area. I own a house in Palm Beach — a spectacular (壮观的) place called Mar-a-Lago — and one day last winter, when I was down for the weekend, I went out to have lunch with some friends. On the way, a pair of beautiful gleaming (闪闪发光) white towers caught my eye. **I made a couple of calls. (一堆电话)** It turned out they'd been built for about $120 million and a major New York bank had just foreclosed on the developers. The next thing I knew I was making a deal to buy the project for $40 million.

A mutual (共同的) friend, William Fugazy, first mentioned that Lee and I should do a real estate deal together. I think Lee is an extraordinary businessman who has done wonders (做的特别棒) in turning Chrysler around, and I also like him a great deal (=very much) personally. So one thing led to another and we began talking about the towers. It's a substantial (巨大的) investment, and I'm not certain Lee is absolutely sure yet that he wants to go forward. If that's the case, it occurs to me, he's done the perfect thing by hiring an attorney I don't like. And that's precisely what I intend to tell Sir Charles when he calls me back.

> 一件事没发生之前，要有一个预期。表现了Trump做生意的时候其实是非常冷血并且精明的。


3:30 P.M. I call my sister, Maryanne Barry, to discuss a recent decision in a lawsuit we are contesting in Atlantic City. Maryanne is a federal court judge in New Jersey, and her husband, John, is a talented attorney I have used on many occasions.

"Can you believe they ruled against us?" I ask her. Maryanne is very smart, she obviously knows a lot more about the law than I do, and she's as surprised as I am. I tell her that I've arranged to have all the materials from the case sent to John immediately, because I want him to handle the appeal (上诉).


4:00 P.M. I go to our conference room to look at slides of potential Christmas decorations for the atrium in Trump Tower. The spectacular six-story marble atrium (6层大理石前厅) has become one of the leading tourist attractions in New York City. More than 100,000 people a week come from all over the world to see it and shop in it, and it's now a symbol of the Trump Organization. That's why I still get involved in details like what Christmas decorations we should use.

I don't like most of what I'm shown. Finally, I see a huge and magnificent gold wreath (花环) for the entrance to the building, and decide we should use just that. Sometimes — not often, but sometimes — less is more.

4:30 P.M. Nicholas Ribis, a New Jersey attorney who handled the licensing of both my Atlantic City casinos, calls to say he's about to leave for Sydney, Australia, to pursue a deal (跟单) I'm considering. He tells me it's a twenty-four-hour flight, and I tell him I'm very glad he's going instead of me.

The deal, however, may be worth the trip. The government of New South Wales is **in the midst of** (正在做...) choosing a company to build and operate what they **envision** (对未来的畅想) as the world's largest casino. We're a front-runner (行业的领跑者) for the job, and Nick is going over to meet with the key government people. He tells me he'll call from Australia as soon as he has any news.


5:15 P.M. I call Henry Kanegsberg, the NBC executive (高管) in charge of choosing a new site for the network's headquarters. We've been courting (追逐/泡妞) NBC for more than a year, trying to get them to move to our West Side yards site—seventy-eight acres along the Hudson River that I bought a year ago and on which I've announced plans to build the world's tallest building.

I know Henry has just been shown our latest plans for the site, and I'm following up (继续跟进). I mention that Bloomingdale's is dying to become the anchor store (主力店/旗舰店) in our shopping center, which will **give it real prestige** (给真实的浮华感). I also tell him the city seems very excited about our latest plans. Then I say we expect to get our preliminary approvals in the next several months.

Kanegsberg seems enthusiastic. Before I get off, I also put in a plug (插播一条) for NBC's locating its offices in the world's tallest building. "Think about it," I say. "It's the ultimate symbol."


5:45 P.M. My nine-year-old son, Donny, calls to ask when I'll be home. I always take calls from my kids, no matter what I'm doing. I have two others—Ivanka, six, and Eric, three—and as they get older, being a father gets easier. I adore (=like) them all, but I've never been great at playing with toy trucks and dolls. Now, though, Donny is beginning to get interested in buildings and real estate and sports, and that's great.

I tell Donny I'll be home as soon as I can, but he insists on a time. Perhaps he's got my genes: the kid won't take no for an answer.


6:30 P.M. After several more calls, I leave the office and take the elevator upstairs to my apartment in the **residential part** (住宅区) of Trump Tower. Of course, I have a tendency to make a few more calls when I get home.
